    process_match takes an input match and breaks each incremental pick and ban down the draft into experiences (aka "memories").

        match (dict): match dictionary with pick and ban data for a single game.
        team (DraftState.BLUE_TEAM or DraftState.RED_TEAM): The team perspective that is used to process match
            The selected team has the positions for each pick explicitly included with the experience while the
            "opposing" team has the assigned positions for its champion picks masked.
        augment_data (optional) (bool): flag controlling the randomized ordering of submissions that do not affect the draft as a whole
    Returns:
        experiences ( list(tuple) ): list of experience tuples. Each experience is of the form (s, a, r, s') where:
            - s and s' are DraftState states before and after a single action

                by the opposing team
            - r is the integer reward obtained from submitting the action a
    process_match() can take the vantage from both sides of the draft to parse for memories. This means we can ultimately sample from
    both winning drafts (positive reinforcement) and losing drafts (negative reinforcement) when training.
